# **App Name**: FeatherMetrics

## Core Features:

- Performance Tracking: Track flock performance metrics including mortality rates, egg production, and feed usage.
- Sales Recording: Record and manage income from poultry and egg sales, along with associated expenses.
- Insight Generation: Aggregate individual performance indicators for a unified flock assessment and to produce useful advice. Generative AI will act as a tool.
- Dashboard Interface: Visualize key metrics and sales data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, desaturated yellow (#F2E7C1) to evoke the natural tones associated with poultry and agriculture without being overly bright or distracting.
- Background color: Very light off-white (#FAFAFA) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for data presentation.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#E0A96F), used sparingly for calls to action and highlights within the interface, drawing attention to key interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that's versatile enough for both headlines and body text. Its objective and neutral look helps in presenting the data without adding extra personality.
- Use clean, simple line icons to represent metrics and data points. The icons should be consistent and easily understandable to provide clarity to the data visualization.
- Employ a grid-based layout with clear divisions between sections, making the data easy to scan and interpret.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when data updates to provide a sense of interactivity without overwhelming the user.
